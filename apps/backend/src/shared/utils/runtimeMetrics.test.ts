 * traffic in this environment to observe them under, so this pins the
 * aggregation logic itself: per-route latency/error tracking, the
 * mongo/provider/epg buckets, and the cardinality guard that keeps
 * unmatched (raw, user-controlled) request paths out of the per-route map.
 *
 * Route names are unique per test run (`route-metrics-test:<random>`) so
 * this doesn't collide with metrics recorded elsewhere in the same process.
